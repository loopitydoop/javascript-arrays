<p>hello, this is a little page to record my findings about Javascript Arrays</p>
<h1>About Javascript Arrays</h1>
<p>Arrays have the "object" data type. But they are a special kind of object that operates very differently from regular objects, so it's better that you think of them as their own thing</p>
<h1>Key Features of Arrays</h1>
    <h2>Arrays store multiple values</h2>
        <p>Arrays can contain multiple values. Consider the following array, <code>pets</code></p>
        <code>
            pets = ["dogs", "cats", "hedgehogs"];
        </code>
        <p>
        pets[0] would be "dogs"<br>
        pets[1] would be "cats"<br>
        pets[2] would be "hedgehogs"<br>
        </p>
    <h2>Array elements are numbered and ordered</h2>
        <p>Each element in an array has an index number, starting from 0, and ascending by 1 for each new element. In that sense they're basically arranged in numerical order.</p>
        <p>And I guess as a consequence of having a sequence, you can loop through arrays using for loops.</p>
<h1>How to Make an Array</h1>
    <h2>Using an Array Literal</h2>
        <p>Basically if you surround a comma-separated list with square brackets, that's an "Array Literal"</p>
        <code>testArray = ["pork", "chicken", "beef"];</code>
        <h3>You Don't Have to Provide Any Elements First</h3>
            <p>you can just declare an empty array first:</p>
            <code>meats = [];</code>
            <p>then afterwards you can add values to the array:</p>
            <code>meats[0] = "chicken"</code>
            <code>meats[1] = "beef"</code>
