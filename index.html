<p>hello, this is a little page to record my findings about Javascript Arrays</p>
<h1>About Javascript Arrays</h1>
<p>Arrays have the "object" data type. But they are a special kind of object that operates very differently from regular objects, so it's better that you think of them as their own thing</p>
<h1>Key Features of Arrays</h1>
<h2>Arrays store multiple values</h2>
<p>Arrays can contain multiple values.</p>
<code>
    pets = ["dogs", "cats", "hedgehogs"]
</code>
<p>
pets[0] would be "dogs"<br>
pets[1] would be "cats"<br>
pets[2] would be "hedgehogs"<br>
</p>
