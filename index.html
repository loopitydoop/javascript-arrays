<p>hello, this is a little page to record my findings about Javascript Arrays</p>
<h1>About Javascript Arrays</h1>
<p>Arrays have the "object" data type. But they are a special kind of object that operates very differently from regular objects, so it's better that you think of them as their own thing</p>
<h1>Key Features of Arrays</h1>
    <h2>Arrays store multiple values</h2>
        <p>You can think of Arrays as lists of values (Like, I think they're really similar to Python Lists). Arrays can contain multiple values. Consider the following array, <code>pets</code></p>
        <code>
            pets = ["dogs", "cats", "hedgehogs"];
        </code>
        <p>
        pets[0] would be "dogs"<br>
        pets[1] would be "cats"<br>
        pets[2] would be "hedgehogs"<br>
        </p>
    <h2>Array elements are numbered and ordered</h2>
        <p>Each element in an array has an index number, starting from 0, and ascending by 1 for each new element. In that sense they're basically arranged in numerical order.</p>
        <p>And I guess as a consequence of having a sequence, you can loop through arrays using for loops.</p>
<h1>How to Make an Array</h1>
    <h2>Using an Array Literal</h2>
        <p>Basically if you surround a comma-separated list with square brackets, that's an "Array Literal"</p>
        <code>testArray = ["pork", "chicken", "beef"];</code>
        <h3>You Don't Have to Provide Any Elements First</h3>
            <p>you can just declare an empty array first:</p>
            <code>const meats = [];</code>
            <p>then afterwards you can add values to the array:</p>
            <p><code>meats[0] = "chicken"</code></p>
            <p><code>meats[1] = "beef"</code></p>
    <h2>Using the Javascript Keyword “new” (seems kinda jank and not useful)</h2>
        <p><code>const clothes = new Array("hats", "shirts", "pants", "shoes");</code></p>
        <p>w3schools says that “for simplicity, readability and execution speed, use the array literal method.” instead of the Javascript keyword “new”, and that they both do exactly the same thing in practice. So it sounds to me like this "new" keyword isn't really useful for making arrays.</p>
<h1>Array Methods and Properties</h1>
<p>Apparently Arrays are powerful because hey have a bunch of built-in methods and properties.</p>
    <h2>array.length Property</h2>
    <p>let's say you wanna find out how many elements there are in an array - you can just use the array.length property and it'll return that value. E.g.</p>
    <p><code>electronics = ["phone", "microwave", "vacuum cleaner"];</code></p>
    <p><code>electronics.length</code> should give you a value of 3. The following is the output of electronics.length:</p>
    <b><p id="demo1"></p></b>
    <script>
        electronics = ["phone", "microwave", "vacuum cleaner"];
        document.getElementById("demo1").innerText = electronics.length
    </script>
<h1>Looping through Arrays</h1>
<h2>Using "For" Loops</h2>
<p><code>array.length</code> is really useful because you can basically use it in for loops to make a loop run once for each element in the array.</p>
<p>here's a little loop that adds every item in an array to a bulleted list.</p>
<p>Given that there is an array <code>restaurants = ["Summer Acai", "Monster Planet", "Melvados"];</code></p>
<p id="demo2"></p>
<script>
    function arrayTolistGenerator() {
        const restaurants = ["Summer Acai", "Monster Planet", "Melvados"];
        arrayLength = restaurants.length;
        let text = "<ul>";
        for (i = 0, i < arrayLength, i++) {
            text += "<li>"
            text += restaurants[i]
            text += "</li>"
        }
        text += "</ul>";
        document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = text;
    }
    arrayTolistGenerator();
</script>
